# Verasonics Vantage for Dummies

This repo is made available, in hopes that it might provide the initial help for getting started for the aspirering ultrasound developer.

# Branch::computing_in_cardiology_2022

This branch will provide the reader with the necessary script for detecting shear waves in a ultrasound image using a phased array,
for the published data @ [Computing in Cardiology 2022 @ Tampere, Finland](https://www.google.com "Computing in Cardiology 2022's Homepage").
Using the settings in the top of the script, it is possible to change frame rate, number of sub-frames per frame, etc. 

To run the project, Place the "CinC2022 files" folder in your Verasonics project, and 

1. run 'activate'
1. run 'RunARFIShearWaves_GEM5Sc'
 
# Future Perspective

It is the intended goal of this project to provide the reader with a GUI where the reader can specify the specific verasonics vantage settings he or she wishes.
The GUI will procedurally generate code, when the specified settings will be included.

This will be provided to the reader at a future date.
